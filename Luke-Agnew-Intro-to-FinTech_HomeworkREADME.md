# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study

## Background

As a FinTech professional, it is critical to learn how FinTech companies start, evolve, and grow, and to be able to speak knowledgeably about the major players in the
FinTech space. Even those in a highly technical role must stay abreast of what is happening in the business landscape, as many FinTech companies create tools and 
technologies that are then used by other companies.

One of the key methods used to conduct corporate analysis is the **case study**. Case studies are often 50–100 pages or more, but your task is to create a more focused
case study that analyzes how a FinTech company is responding to the problems and needs of the FinTech domain it is in, and how it is using technology to solve a
standing financial problem.

In this homework assignment, you will:

* Select a Fintech domain that interests you, and then choose a company or project within that domain.

* Research the domain and company.

* Write a detailed case study of the company.

* Upload your case study to your git repository.

This assignment will challenge you to polish your FinTech research skills by accessing reports, publications, and online resources that FinTech professionals use to 
evaluate the industry. It will also help you situate the techniques and technologies you will be mastering in this course––e.g., machine learning, Python, modeling, 
blockchain––within the real world of global FinTech. Finally, it will give you practice presenting and speaking about FinTech strategy and technology.

## Instructions

#### 1. Choose a FinTech domain that you find relevant or interesting.

**Note:** We covered a number of FinTech domains in class this week. If you already have a company in mind that you want to research, skip ahead to Step 3.

* Payments/Billing

* Capital Investment

* Investment Management

* Wealth Management

* Enterprise Solutions

* Insurance (InsurTech)

* Mortgage/Real Estate

* Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking

* Lending

* Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

* Regulation Technology (RegTech)

* Open Banking

* Robo-advising

Remember that because FinTech is an evolving field, different FinTech reports may use different names and definitions for various domains and sectors 
(e.g., CB Insights, Investopedia, Accenture). In addition, you may come across lists of FinTech domains online that are either longer or shorter than 
the list above; there is no one comprehensive list.

#### 2. Choose a company (or project) within  your chosen Fintech domain.

Use online research to identify the trends in your domain, and choose a company that is successful or otherwise interesting to you. For example, if
you chose Wealth Management, you may want to look at online journals, periodicals, reports, and websites about the future of Wealth Management, or
how FinTech is changing or disrupting Wealth Management.

Your company could be:

* A new, emerging FinTech company that is doing well in a particular domain. Examples include Square, Plaid, Lemonade, RobinHood, and Coinbase.

* A large incumbent financial or technology company that is doing something interesting and new with technology. Examples include Goldman Sachs’ Marcus,
JP Morgan’s JPMCoin, Facebook Libra, and Apple Card.

* A smaller start-up that is not yet wildly successful, but that you find promising and interesting. This may include a FinTech company in your local area
or a company with a new idea that you would like to learn more about.

#### 3. Conduct your research, using the case study template as a guide.

We recommend that you use the case study template below in order to focus your research. You may lengthen, shorten, or––if necessary––remove sections from
the template to accommodate the information available about your company.

**Note** If you have chosen a project within a larger company (such as the Apple Credit Card), you may want to focus your research on the origins and scope
of the project rather than on the company itself.

# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: 

THETA LABS

* When was the company incorporated? 

2017 

* Who are the founders of the company?

Mitch Liu and Jieyi Long founded Theta in 2017.  

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

MItch Liu, one of the two original founders, has a backround in programming and gaming. In 2007 Mitch Liu co founded TapJoy, which is an ad network in the
mobile ecosystem. In 2010 he then continued his work in the mobile application field by co founding Gameview Studios. The company develops mobile gaming
apps with with a focus on creating free games with high volumes of usage. Gameview went on to have the highest downloads on the IOS and Android within
90 days of launch. He then went on to found Theta Labs and the Theta Network. Theta is a end-to-end decentralized video streaming service and was designed
to enhance the connection of traditional streaming. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Theta did an intial private offering of 30% of the company for 20 million in 2018, giving the company a valuation of 66 million at the time. The company would
then represent ownership by issuing 1,000,000,000 tokens on the blockchain. Crypto tokens represent an asset or specific use on the blockchain. At the time
of the frist private offering of 300,000,000 tokens each token was priced for sale at .02. As of today the token currently trades for $11.13 with an all time
high hit one month ago of $16.30. This represents a gain of 55,750% to date over the span of 3 years. The company now has a market cap of 11.1 billion and
is the 18th biggest crypto currency. Since then the company has received a variety of private investments, some of the more notable
ones being the Sony Innovation Fund and Samsung. 

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Theta is the first decentralized video streaming service to be created. The company is looking to revolutionize traditional streaming by leveraging blockchain
technology. The services now have poor content delivery networks (CDNs) that lack reach causing excessive amounts of buffering, high latency and slow load times
in many parts of the world. Users now expect little to no response time when streaming and demand high video qualty. Theta's solution is a hybrid system of
distributing content instead of using CDNs. Typically when streaming, content goes straight from the CDN to the viewer. Theta's model incorporates "Catching Nodes"
that are geographically closer inbetween the CDNs and the viewers. Catching nodes are the bandwidth sharing mechanism in the Theta Network. They connect the dots
between the CDNs and the viewer. The infastructure for todays streaming services is also very centralized, with less revenue given back to content providers and
platforms. Theta is hoping to change that. There are two main parts to the the theta network, the blockchain and the video streaming/content delivery. Theta tv
is a twitch like service that allows content providers to stream and that rewards viewers by sharing excess bandwidth as they watch streamers. As viewers watch
content they pull the stream from catching nodes that are closer then the given CDN distributing the content. Viewers also earn Theta Fuel (Tfuel) for every
minute they watch streams. Tfuel is the utility token of the Theta project. A utility token is a digital cryptocurrency that is issued in order to fund the
development of a crypto currency and can be later used to buy and sell goods. Theta will use your excess upload bandwidth to share the stream with other viewers.
As of September of last year the price of tfuel was under a penny being in a range around .006 to .01. Since then the price has appreciated around 4000%, now being
.34 with an all the high of .57 and a current market cap of 1.8 billion. The Theta blockchain allows users to run guardian, validator and edge nodes. Theta edge
nodes work as a data delivery network and a computing platform. The platform allows task for edge nodes to download and solve, and in doing so earn tfuel on the
blockchain through smart contracts. Task can be a variety of problems from transcoding a video, solving equations, and thousands of other applications the network
can leverage from 35,000 edge nodes. Validator nodes produce new blocks in the chain while Guardian nodes act as a verifier of authenticity of the Validator nodes.
Guardian nodes play an important role in the security of the Theta Blockchain. Anyone with a given amount of theta tokens (depending on which node you run) and
the right computing power can power the theta blockchain through various nodes and in doing so earn passive income in the form of tfuel. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The company is hoping to take market share in streaming. They are looking to incentivize streaming viewers and content providers to transition over to there
decentralized platform which offers better content delivery and rewards both parties for empowering the network. The game streaming market is expected to register
a CAGR of 9% during the forecast period 2021 - 2026. According to statista.com there are 1.2 billion content viewers worlwide and the annual revenue of the whole
industry is around 7 billion dollars right now. The biggest competitors are Twitch, Amazon, Youtube, Mixer, Facebook Gaming and Douyu TV. Theta has many edges
over the competitors by leveraging blockchain technology. The companys patented hybrid model of alternative content delivery from CDNs to catching nodes offers
lower latency and faster streaming. Viewers are also rewarded when watching streams with tfuel, which has appreicated roughly 4000% in the past half a year.
The project also empowers users to run guardian nodes, edge nodes, and validator nodes in a decentralized manner to help operate the network and earn passive
income in doing so. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s
engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

The Theta network is the main component looking to revoltionalize the standard content delivery model. Theta will use it's proprietary tech to improve modern day
content delivery or replace it altogether. The various nodes as disscussed earlier are the backbone of the network and is empowered by the users. All of these nodes
can become catching nodes in the network that act as a intermediary between CDNs and viewers. CDNs are a distributed network of proxy servers and data centers.
They have been around since the 1990's and play an important role in the internets ecosystem. Content owners such as media companies, streamering services,
e-commerce stores, and many others pay CDNs to deliver their content to the end user. Instead of the traditional interaction with the content provider to the CDN 
then to the viewer, incorporating catching nodes between the CDNs and viewers based on geographic location enhances the data sharing all together and providers lower
latency for the end user. The nodes participating in the network are then compensated with tfuel as an incentive to continue sharing bandwidth and bring new nodes
into the network. The team hopes to see as much as 80% reduction in content delivery cost and redistribute those funds to the content provider, viewer, and all other
users in the network. The theta blockchain itself works in the backround to keep the project working in harmony and distribute tfuel through the rewards system. Since
the video streaming and delivery components require huge amounts of data management, no data related to video streaming is stored on the the theta blockchain. In order
to acheive higher levels of efficency, the theta blockchain was dividied into two main parts. The first one features a smaller group of validator nodes which generate
chains of blocks in the fastest possible manner. The second layer consist of guardian nodes. The guardian nodes maintain consensus by securing validation at predfined
points. Right now there are a total of 14 Validator Nodes, 3573 Guardian Nodes, and 39,614 Edge Nodes working in a decentralized manner to operate the network. 


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

The company is a blockchain innovation but more specifically operates in the video streaming and content delivery service  

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

The biggest trend of the streaming industry has been taking market share from traditional entertainment providers such as cable, the movies, etc. Users are now more
inclined to watch whatever they'd like with the vast amount of content out there which has lead to a paradigm shift towards streaming services and free content. Theta
is a major innovator in the industry as blockchain technology has leveraged what is really possible in decentralized streaming. Earning money while you're streaming
is a component that was never considered by other providers until theta came along. I see theta as the biggest innovation going on in streaming today. As far as blockchain
technology a lot of people are coming to the conclusion that many aspects of finance can be innovated by leveraging the blockchain. Theta is one of many blockchain
projects working to compete with traditional centralization of data, video streaming, healthcare, energy, internet security, etc.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

The biggest competitors are Twitch, Amazon, Youtube, Mixer, Facebook Gaming and Douyu TV.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

The company has made a lot of progress as far as incorporating there model of content delivery and decentralization of video streaming. There are currently
39,614 Edge nodes , 3,573 Guardian Nodes , and 14 Enterprise Validator Nodes. All these individuals are the ones empowering the theta blockchain and revolutionizing
content delivery. The notion of going with decentralized streaming seems to be noteworthy as it is the 18th biggest crypto by market cap at the moment. Mitch Liu has
also made some strategic partnerships by adding Steve Chen, Co-Founder of Youtube and Justin Kan, Co-founder of Twitch to there advisory board. Theta also leveraged
Google to further drive the adoption of the project. An article published by Forbes named "Google goes Blockchain?" in May of 2020 highlights how Theta's partnership
with Google Cloud will allow users run nodes off Theta's blockchain network from any browser assuming you have the right computing capabilities. Google Cloud also
announced it will be operating a validator for Theta's network servicing all of Europe. This was a serious move by Google as they now have an interest in pushing
the adoption of Theta. Validator nodes propose and produce new blocks in Theta's blockchain. They are one of 14 Validator nodes supporting the whole network. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Some of the metrics that measure success as far as streaming platforms are Revenue, Subscriptions, Active Monthly Users, Watch Time and Engagement Rate. Theta.tv
has a low number of usage relative to the other streaming providers in all the categories mentioned above. This is because Theta is incorporating a model that is
a new innovation in the space. Theta tv has a relatively low engagement rate, recieving an average of 187,300 visitors and 711,881 page impressions every day. From
the streaming side of things the company is still behind the major players such as Youtube, Facebook Gaming, Twitch and other services. On the blockchain and technology
side of things, Theta remains the only player to innovate in streaming. The appreciation of the price is a good representation of the possibilities that could come with
peer to peer decentralized streaming. Theta currently sits in the top 20 crypto's by market cap. They also have a vast amount of users working together to operate the
network. Right now there are a total of 14 Validator Nodes, 3573 Guardian Nodes, and 39,614 Edge Nodes. This will continue to grow as users are inclined to share excess
bandwidth to support the network, and in doing so earn passive income in the form of tfuel

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

For streaming free content Youtube remains the key player. Youtube is said to have 2.3 billion users worldwide with 79% of those users having a registered youtube
account. Youtube is also the second-most popular search engine after Google and the second most popular social media platform. Theta.tv recieves an average of 187,300
visitors and 711,881 page impressions every day. These numbers are poor compared to youtube as Youtube has an average of 30,000,000 people on there site each day. With
that being said it is worth noting that Mitch Liu added the co founder of twitch and youtube to Theta's advisory board which represents a strategic move in pushing the
adoption of the network. Twitch.tv is a video-game streaming platform that allows content creators to stream and earn money through donations, ads, subscriptions, and 
more. Twitch.tv is the leading player when it comes to streaming of gaming. Twitch was acquired by Amazon in 2014. As far as decentralized streaming on the blockchain 
Theta is currently the only project doing peer to peer decentralized streaming and is the only innovator in the space at the moment. It's hard to give a fair analysis 
on Theta relative to other companies because Theta is incorporating a model that provides higher quality, smoother streams, reduced video platform costs, and enhanced 
interactivity and rewards for both streamers and viewers, something no other player is yet to do. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would integrate a social media aspect for the users on the Theta Network. Here it would be an interface displaying peoples profile and showing whether they are a 
streamer or viewer, if they're running and nodes and any other relevant information. For most other streaming services they have an interface where content creators 
and users can interact with one another and share content. With today's consumer they want to have there own profile because they want more attetion, or they want to 
feel better about themselves. I think it's a vital part of success and needs to be invested in. They also need more adoption by big players in the crypto space. The 
truth is that Marc Cuban, Elon Musk, Micheal Saylor and all these other guys are pumping cryptos left and right. I don't think it would hurt to have a partnership 
with them, as they have a lot of influence. 


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Social media today is one of the most influential markets for younger generations. A report from CNN stated that 60% of all children in the United States have social
 media accounts and that number seems low to me. If you really want to target and engage the younger generations which are ultamitely the future, you need to create
  a platform that allows people to express themselves in one way or the other. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

The social media aspect of the equation would enhance the engagement on the app. On Youtube and Twitch, content creators cherish there own accounts as do the viewers. 
They are missing a vital piece of a gaming focused streaming provider. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

A platform where users can engage with one another and express themselves will increase the usage rate of the network if executed right.
